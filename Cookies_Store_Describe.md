# Introduction 

The New York City Subway is a rapid transit system that serves four of the five boroughs of New York City, New York: the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens. Its operator is the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA), which is controlled by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) of New York. In 2016, an average of 5.66 million passengers used the system daily, making it the busiest rapid transit system in the United States and the seventh busiest in the world [1]. These stations would be optimal for placing for promoting and marketing the cookies store.


# Backstory

As a well-known cookies store working in New York, which provides improves the product's quality by taking feedback from clients while also increasing the store's income. Every customer who buys cookies and completes the survey will receive free cookies. It targets the most crowded station and during rush hours to put the booth cookies. I used these months August, September, October, and November because it's almost the end of summer.
Question:
What are the busiest stations to place booth cookie?
What are the peak hours at the stations?
 

# Used data set

The dataset contains over three million rows with eleven features for each provided by the MTA. Moreover, the columns are station names, lines names, number of entries and exits, date and time, number of entries and exits. Nearly a turnstile of the individual features could be grouped into more general category parts such as control area, unit, and subunit channel position. Using the dataset of MTA stations for the past four months in 2019 have provided us a solid knowledge of what solutions we can give and how we can increase income for cookies store in MTA stations, our data Scientists expertise have made the appropriate EDA on the MTA dataset by using PYTHON and SQL to provide strong statistical data. 


# Used tools

The tools provided as a module in python such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn NumPy,and much more. The python libraries support multiple data analysis and cleaning methods to ensure the data are clean and ready to visualize. Furthermore, SQLalchemy can provide the ability to write the SQL queries and get specific data according to query. For that reason, python module tools are sufficient.


# Conclusion
The aim of the booth cookies project was the analyses and understand of  MTA data set. First, the booth has started by gathering data. Then, exploring of data. Afterward, the store focused on the clean of data by removing duplicates and null values using pandas. In particular, the store depicted the plot of the main graphs of our data set. Then connect with the database and write some queries. As a result, the store aims to place a booth of cookies at the busiest station.
