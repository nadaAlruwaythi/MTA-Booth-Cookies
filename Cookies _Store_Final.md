# Abstract

* The purpose of this project is to study and understand the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's MTA data set. I used public data available from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority site, where I chose to work for four months in 2019, The goal of this project is to market for the cookie booth, to do that we need to choose the best place and time to set up the booth at stations, as well as visualize the data with the Python matplotlib tool.


# Design 

* The data set in this project is taken from the MTA website. This data set presents the complete status of the metro in New York City. However, data analysis is used to know the most crowded stations and rush hours to place booth cookies.


# Data
* The dataset contains over three million rows with eleven features for each provided by the MTA. Moreover, the columns are station names, lines names, number of entries and exits, date and time, number of entries and exits. Nearly a turnstile of the individual features could be grouped into more general category parts such as control area, unit, and subunit channel position. Using the dataset of MTA stations for the past four months in 2019 have provided us a solid knowledge of what solutions we can give and how we can increase income for cookies store in MTA stations, our data Scientists expertise have made the appropriate EDA on the MTA dataset by using PYTHON and SQL to provide strong statistical data. 




# Algorithms

* The steps to analyse the MTA data set are gathering data from the MTA data set within the needed months. However, the months of this project are August, September, October and November exploring data by using all the functions like info and describe. Then cleaning data by removing null values and duplicates and detection outlier and removal as well as, remove any data mistakes. After that, plot the graphs using seaborn and matplotlib modules from python. Finally, connect with the SQLalchemy database and write some representative queries.


# Tools
•	Numpy and Pandas for data manipulation
•	Matplotlib and Seaborn for plotting
•	Python Date and Time to deal with date and time columns
•	Python SQLalchemy to connect with database


# Communication 
Moreover, the code and graphs will be available on my https://github.com/nadaAlruwaythi/project

# Conclusion 

The aim of the booth cookies project was the analyse and understand of MTA data set. First, the booth has started by gathering data. Then, exploring of data. Afterward, the store focused on the clean of data by removing duplicates and null values using pandas. In particular, the store depicted the plot of the main graphs of our data set. Then connect with the database and write some queries. As a result, the store aims to place a booth of cookies at the busiest station.
